            <p >My name is Moses John Legend, but most people just call me Legend. Iâ€™m from Nigeria, and Iâ€™ve always been passionate about growing myself in different areas of life. Back in high school, I earned the nickname Legend because I was popular, active in sports, sharp in math, and had a lively personality. Now, I carry that same energy into my studies and personal goals.Iâ€™m currently a Pathway student studying computer and software programming, with a strong interest in cybersecurity, backend development, and Python.</p>
